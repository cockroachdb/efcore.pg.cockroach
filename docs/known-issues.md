### CockroachDB doesn't support renaming a table that doesn't have primary key

This is a known limitation of CockroachDB. This issue impacts code first migration when a table is remapped to a new table name.

By default, EF Core will generate a set of SQL commands to
drop the PK constraint
rename the table, and
re-add the PK constraint

The workaround is to edit the migration code generated by EF Core to make it work with CockroachDB.

CockroachDB doesnâ€™t support the function pg_terminate_backend(). EnsureDeleted and EnsureDeletedAsync do not work.

This code

```csharp
await using var ctx = new BlogContext();
await ctx.Database.EnsureDeletedAsync();
await ctx.Database.EnsureCreatedAsync();
```



CockroachDB doesn't support function that returns TABLE
